Review 2
========
(Feel free to build a class for your OWN data)
Write a class to encapsulate a weather report for a location 
You can decide on any properties you like, but location, temperature and description would be good
Validate location (non-empty string) temperature (float) and description (non-empty string)

Exercise the code by making several instances of the weather class (for a few locations)
e.g. Dublin, cloudy, 14 degrees   Letterkenny, sunny, 17 degrees
Print the weather reports using formatted strings

Add a method to the class which returns a nicely formatted weather report for that location

There will be an oportunity to show what you have built

Optional
========
Find a way to validate location as a string of 2 or more characters
Write the data for each of your weather reports to a text file (append each new weather report)
Also find a way to read back and nicely display the weather reports
